# Introduction

# Threads
This is a simple assignment in order to get used to threads. The idea is to take two matrices and multiply them using different threads. I want to see how the implementation differs, the problems that may arise and how the execution time scales with the number of threads and the size of the matrices.

# Thread pool
The second program will read in an MD5 password and and pass it to a thread that will try all possible combinations of a string, hashing it and then comparing it to the MD5 crack from the file. If a match is found then print out the result to the screen.
